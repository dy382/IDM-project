 <p>Hello, I’m Doyeon.</p>
   <p>I am a Korean immigrant, DMV raised, and Philadelphia based student currently attending Drexel University.
   I am pursuing a B.S. in User Experience and Interaction Design, because I am obsessed with art and functionality.</p>
   <p>I love beautiful things, and capturing them through my camera. My free time usually includes sketching, dancing,
   playing Chess, or working on a photography project. I’m excited to pursue the title of an artist.</p>
