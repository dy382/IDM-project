 <p>Hello, I’m Doyeon.</p>
   <p>I am a Korean immigrant, DMV raised, and Philadelphia based student currently attending Drexel University. <br>
   I am pursuing a B.S. in User Experience and Interaction Design, because I am obsessed with art and functionality.<br>
   I love beautiful things, and capturing them through my camera. My free time usually includes sketching, dancing,<br>
   playing Chess, or working on a photography project. I’m excited to pursue the title of an artist.</p>
