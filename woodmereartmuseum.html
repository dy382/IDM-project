<h2>Design Goals</h2>
  <p>For one of my Interaction Digital Media class, I was assigned a redesign on a mobile app. This solo <br> 
  project entailed rebranding the app of our choice with a final animation video showcasing its full functionality.<br>
  <br>
  ChessRookie is a rebrand of Chess Free, a free online chess game for iPhone and iPod touch. The app supports <br>
  both 1 player and 2 player gameplay, so you can play against friends or test your skills against a challenging <br>
  computer opponent. The app offers many chess features including daily puzzles, score tracking, difficulty level <br>
  adjustability, and board rotation for two players. I downloaded the app originally to be able to have access <br>
  to the game as the avid Chess addict that I am. However, the flow of the app is quite outdated with many pain <br>
  points as a user perspective and the UI includes horrific colors and design choices. I decided to redesign the <br>
  app and add more customization abilities with the addition of a clock and overall a more modern design.<br>
  </p>

<h2>User Persona</h2>
  <img src="images/ChessRookie_UserPersona.jpg" alt="Chess Rookie cUser Persona, Alex" height="400"/>
  <p>My user persona is Alex who is a long time chess player, based off of my actual friend, who coaches chess as his<br>
   side job. He needs to be challenged during his free times and have the opportunity to practice the game whenever he needs <br>

<h2>Rebrand Research</h2>
  <img src="images/ChessRookie_Rebrand.png" alt="The rebrand ideas including color palette, typography, and icons" height="400"/>
  <p>My color palette was chosen relatively neutral for specific colors. I kept the main wood colors for the “board” <br>
    the same and chose the others to be ones that could highlight the game. Instead of having the semi realistic design, <br>
    I decided to go for a more animated and cartoonish style to simulate more as a game. The font and the icons also are <br>
    chosen to represent a light and enjoyable aesthetic. <br>

<h2>Result</h2>
<a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/19GGyBkF8yqbRFx2bGX7Y1vRo3-C6N_nq/view"target=_blank>Result</a>
<p>I turned the app into a simple and convenient game with clear intentions and minimalistic</p>
<h2>Things I added:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A loading screen</li>
  <li>A firework winning animation</li>
  <li>Clock to indicate a person’s turn</li>
  <li>a more visually appealing logo screen</li>
</ul>
