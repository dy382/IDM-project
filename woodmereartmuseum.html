<h2>Design Goals</h2>
  <p>My first two quarters of Interactive Digital Media were spent on one continuous project of <br>
    redesigning a website of choice on three different devices: Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile. This <br>
    was my first ever UX or solo design project and it came as a heavy challenge when I was forced <br>
    to push out of the box of creativity, but still work around many constraints. We were prompted <br>
    to incorporate the addition of three features that the website lacks. <br>

    Woodmere Art Museum is a 20th-century museum filled with paintings, photographs, sculptures, and <br>
    other forms of artwork. This family-friendly museum offers many activities for kids and adults <br>
    welcoming demographics of all ages. Sitting in the heart of Philadelphia, the museum hopes of inspiring <br>
    creativity, learning, and self expression through experiences of art regardless of age or background. <br>
    The website poorly connects the user to the museum as it forces many inconveniences with its confusing <br>
    task flow. It presents too many options and finding information is very difficult. <br>
  </p>

<h2>User Persona</h2>
  <img src="woodmere_userpersona1.jpg" alt="Woodmere Art Museum User Persona Karen" height="400"/>
  <p>My user persona is Alex who is a long time chess player, based off of my actual friend, who coaches chess as his<br>
   side job. He needs to be challenged during his free times and have the opportunity to practice the game whenever he needs <br>

<h2>Rebrand Research</h2>

  <p>My color palette was chosen relatively neutral for specific colors. I kept the main wood colors for the “board” <br>
    the same and chose the others to be ones that could highlight the game. Instead of having the semi realistic design, <br>
    I decided to go for a more animated and cartoonish style to simulate more as a game. The font and the icons also are <br>
    chosen to represent a light and enjoyable aesthetic. <br>

<h2>Result</h2>
<a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/19GGyBkF8yqbRFx2bGX7Y1vRo3-C6N_nq/view"target=_blank>Result</a>
<p>I turned the app into a simple and convenient game with clear intentions and minimalistic</p>
<h2>Things I added:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A loading screen</li>
  <li>A firework winning animation</li>
  <li>Clock to indicate a person’s turn</li>
  <li>a more visually appealing logo screen</li>
</ul>
