    <h3>Time Constraint</h3>

  <h2>Design Goals</h2>
    <p>For one of my Interaction Digital Media class, I was assigned a redesign on a mobile app. This solo <br> 
    project entailed rebranding the app of our choice with a final animation video showcasing its full functionality.<br>
    <br>
    ChessRookie is a rebrand of Chess Free, a free online chess game for iPhone and iPod touch. The app supports <br>
    both 1 player and 2 player gameplay, so you can play against friends or test your skills against a challenging <br>
    computer opponent. The app offers many chess features including daily puzzles, score tracking, difficulty level <br>
    adjustability, and board rotation for two players. I downloaded the app originally to be able to have access <br>
    to the game as the avid Chess addict that I am. However, the flow of the app is quite outdated with many pain <br>
    points as a user perspective and the UI includes horrific colors and design choices. I decided to redesign the <br>
    app and add more customization abilities with the addition of a clock and overall a more modern design.<br>
    </p>

  <h2>User Persona</h2>

    <p>My user persona is Alex who is a long time chess player, based off of my actual friend, who coaches chess as his<br>
     side job. He needs to be challenged during his free times and have the opportunity to practice the game whenever he needs <br>
