    <h3>Role</h3>
    <p>Visual design, research and conceptualization, testing, interaction design, animation</p>

    <h3>Time Constraint</h3>
    <p>10 Weeks <br> <br> April 2023 – July 2023</p>

    <h3>Program</h3>
    <p>Figma, AfterEffect, Illustrator</p>

  <h2>Design Goals</h2>
    <p>For one of my Interaction Digital Media class, I was assigned a redesign on a mobile app. This solo <br> 
    project entailed rebranding the app of our choice with a final animation video showcasing its full functionality.<br>
    <br>
    ChessRookie is a rebrand of Chess Free, a free online chess game for iPhone and iPod touch. The app supports <br>
    both 1 player and 2 player gameplay, so you can play against friends or test your skills against a challenging <br>
    computer opponent. The app offers many chess features including daily puzzles, score tracking, difficulty level <br>
    adjustability, and board rotation for two players. I downloaded the app originally to be able to have access <br>
    to the game as the avid Chess addict that I am. However, the flow of the app is quite outdated with many pain <br>
    points as a user perspective and the UI includes horrific colors and design choices. I decided to redesign the <br>
    app and add more customization abilities with the addition of a clock and overall a more modern design.<br>
    </p>

  <h2>User Persona</h2>
    <img src="images/ChessRookie_UserPersona.jpg" alt="Chess Rookie cUser Persona, Alex" height="400"/>
    <p>My user persona is Alex who is a long time chess player, based off of my actual friend, who coaches chess as his<br>
     side job. He needs to be challenged during his free times and have the opportunity to practice the game whenever he needs <br>

  <h2>Rebrand Research</h2>
    <img src="images/ChessRookie_Rebrand.png" alt="The rebrand ideas including color palette, typography, and icons" height="400"/>
    <p>My color palette was chosen relatively neutral for specific colors. I kept the main wood colors for the “board” <br>
      the same and chose the others to be ones that could highlight the game. Instead of having the semi realistic design, <br>
      I decided to go for a more animated and cartoonish style to simulate more as a game. The font and the icons also are <br>
      chosen to represent a light and enjoyable aesthetic. <br>

  <h2>Result</h2>
  <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/19GGyBkF8yqbRFx2bGX7Y1vRo3-C6N_nq/view"target=_blank>Result</a>
  <p>I turned the app into a simple and convenient game with clear intentions and minimalistic</p>
  <h2>Things I added:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A loading screen</li>
    <li>A firework winning animation</li>
    <li>Clock to indicate a person’s turn</li>
    <li>a more visually appealing logo screen</li>
  </ul>
