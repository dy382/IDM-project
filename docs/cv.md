# Emily Yoo's Portfolio
## CV
**Paragraph** 
Hello! My name is Doyeon Yoo, but feel free to call me Emily. I am a Korean immigrant, DC raised, and Philadelphia based student attending Drexel University. My major is User Experience and Interaction Design, because I love art and functionality. I love taking photos of beautiful things, sketching, dancing, making drinks, and overall being active. It’s been 5 years since the start of my photography side business and I’m excited to pursue the title of an artist.
